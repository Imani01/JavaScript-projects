      <h1>Popup lion facts ü¶Å</h1>
      <p>
        Lions are highly social cats, living in prides of up to 40 members. Each female tends to stay in her birth pride, whereas most young males leave the pride in small groups (coalitions) to create their own.The African lion is a member of the genus Panthera, joining tigers, jaguars and leopards. What is special about this genus is that all species are able to roar. A lion's roar can be heard 5 miles (or 8 km) away. Male lions use their roar to scare off other males and to warn members of the pride of potential danger. Although lions are apex predators, at the top of the food chain, they aren‚Äôt great hunters. The success rate of hunts is less than 30%. The average weight of a male lion is 180kg and that of a female lion 130kg. This is 40-50x the weight of a domestic cat! When first born, vulnerable cubs are kept safely hidden by their mothers in a thick and dense habitat for up to 6 weeks.
