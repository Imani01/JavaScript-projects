# 00- Basics of JavaScript -00
Instructions: ðŸ§®
1. The user will use the knowldge he/she has of multi-line comments to uncomment the bits of code in the 'script.js' file in order to run the codes.
2. Later I will be adding the guide on where to uncomment and label them appropriately.
3. Feel free to attempt the #Coding Challenges# on your own and do further research.
4. I will be posing weekly coding problems and the results on Weekends so that you can check whether your answer is correct and if not what was the problem.
5. The areas highligted with words such as TODO , FIXME , BUG may not work for you even after uncommenting understand the problem and try fixing on your own. CLASS NOTES are for key => reference.

# 01- Tricky interview questions
contain JavaScript most asked tricky interview questions and the right answer. Some as problem codes and their solutions.

# Reminder
Coding can be challenging but that's how it ought to be !! 
Take time and learn everything you need to know at your own pace.
If you feel exhausted and do not understand some of the concepts as they may be new to you, feel free to take a break and you can always comeback later.
